     <!-- About movie -->
        <p>
            Nemo is about a a young, adventurous, and mighty clown fish that lives with his very cautious father Marlin. <br>
            Nemo has a foreshortened fin and gets tired of those around him underestimating him and swims too close to the surface <br>
            to prove himself. In the process he is caught by a diver. His father and an angel fish named Dory, with short term memory <br>
            loss, set out to find him.

     <!-- Reasons -->
     <h3> Why this is my Favorite Movie:</h3>
     
        <ul>
            <li>Nemo reminded me of myself as a child. Growing up with a fin that did not work as well as the other one really motivated me as a child.</li>
             <li>Eventhough Nemo did have a fin smaller than the other he did not let that stop him from doing what he wanted.</li>
            <li>My sun sign is also in Pisces and that just explains everything else.</li>
        </ul>
